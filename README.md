This project covers the following resampling algorithms:
- Residual resampling (RR)
- Systematic resampling (SR)
- Residual systematic resampling (RSR)
 
They are implemented in standard, matrix, and vectorized form.

It also provides an example of how resampling works.
1. A grid is created.
2. Each grid point is evaluated assuming standard normal distribution.
3. Particles are resampled using the pdf as weights.

Implementations in R and MATLAB are also available.

For more details, including derivations of the algorithms, see the paper.
